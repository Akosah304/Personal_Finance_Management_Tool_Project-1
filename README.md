# Personal-Finance-Management-Tool_Project1
**Background**

 Welcome to the world of programming with Pandas. It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues.

**What You’re Creating**

You need to create a tool  that analyzes and visualizes expenses made last year and determine which month, category of transactions he spent more and to track his expenses and to know if he spent right the whole year.Once you understand how you spent your money last year, you will be better equipped to set goals for the future.

**Files**

Download the file to help you get started:



**Before You Begin**

* Create a new GitHub repo called personal_finance_management_tool. Then, clone it to your computer.
  
* In your local Git repository, create a directory for the Python activities. Name the folder finance_tool.ipynb
  
* Remember to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. 
  
* Push these changes to the repository that you created in Step 1.

**Instructions**

The instructions for this assignment are divided into three parts:

* Prepare the Data
* Perform Quantitative Analysis

**Prepare the Data**

First, you will read in and clean CSV file for analysis. The CSV file contain data on numerous expenses for last year. Use the personal-transaction data to complete the following steps:

- Use Pandas to read the CSV file into DataFrames. Be sure to convert the date to a DateTimeIndex.
  
- Convert the data types as needed.
- Drop extra column ‘Account Name’.
- Change category column to unassigned
- Assign transactions to the correct actegory 
- Slice the data to only look at amount associated with utilities.

**Perform Quantitative Analysis**

Analyze the data to determine what month or category he spent more and to know if he spent right the whole year. Specifically, you will do a analysis by calculating the total amount spent for each category and month . You plot a bar chart visualizing amount against category to determine which category he spent alot.

Given an annual income, find the difference of total expenses made the whole year from the annual income earned to determine the amount he was able to save and plot with a pie chart.
